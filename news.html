    The original BMW X6 was a key car for the now crucial coupe-SUV market, and
    now the third-generation model is almost ready to receive its mid-life
    facelift. We spied it undergoing cold-weather testing earlier this year, but
    our latest spy images show the updated X6 is now testing on the road. The
    revised X6 will gain a slightly redesigned exterior and new interior
    technology inspired by BMW’s most recent SUVs - namely the iX and XM. We’ve
    also seen a facelift version of the performance-focused X6 M testing already
    too, which should be unveiled at the same time as the regular X6.
